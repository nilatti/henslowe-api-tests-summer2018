add character groups for on_stages in react

mind hard coding on updates for line-related things that aren't exactly lines (eg stage directions, sound cues). Some hard-coding in LineShow.js that could break.

find other times to use character select

new production doesn't forward to the production page on create.

speed up production copier by adding Line.import etc

regularlize sound cues so line_number is whatever it is on stage directions

hide SDs from view where type = mixed or where content null

 find a way to hide all cut lines with correct character demarkation

 write a way to export the script text to an editable form--gdocs ideally?

 on importer--when two characters share a line, one of them is not getting the content assigned (see jaques/amiens 2.5.43)

check importer--why does epilogue have line number = 0, act = 0?

in playscript edit fix accordions
in play script edit find a way to make the header and accordions sticky so that you can always see act tabs, nav, and title and time counts, cut show/hide etc

in script edit :
edits on stage directions don't seem to be working quite right. Writing to DB but not updating state until reload

look at cast list--do I need to get jobs from server or can I just filter out of production?

Rehearsal scheduler request: curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"rehearsal_block_length":"30","rehearsal_break_length":"5", "rehearsal_days_of_week": "'Monday','Tuesday'", "rehearsal_end_date":"2020-04-20", "rehearsal_end_time":"18:00:00","rehearsal_start_date": "2020-04-10", "rehearsal_start_time": "14:00:00", "rehearsal_time_between_breaks": "55"}' http://localhost:3001/api/productions/66/build_rehearsal_schedule

make a script to add users to on_stages when casting is set (see test.rb for an example that works)

rehearsal scheduler: write save content methods, also order scenes fs, etc before sending because wtf
